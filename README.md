We looked found these Monster Truck game for PC

The hunt didn't move well, but here are a lot of games about large trucks anyhow.

A squishy alien monster meets a few children, the children shove the critter to a monster truck, and they struggle against the sort of corporate goons which exist only in films.

The current history of monster truck games is not quite so daring. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/">Steam</a> has not seen a certified <a href="http://monsterstruckgames.org/">monster truck game</a> because 2015, and not one of these feature Godzilla supporting the wheel (radioactive breath exhaust? Yes). How dull--compared to Godzilla trucks anyhow. Delving deep into this deserted sub-genre reveals... not much, really. Games about monster trucks beating cars and doing ill jumps are infrequent and largely terrible. Steam included 7,000 matches in 2017, and none of these was all about monster trucks.

But if you want your fix anyhow, here would be monster truck games value your time.

Monster Truck Destruction

It truly enjoys breaking things. Never mind the college systems that likely require those buses--seeing them fall under giant tires is far more satisfying than getting children educated. Multiplayer matchmaking stays in beta (because 2015, therefore it is not occurring).

Destruction understands what people need. Not one of them are believed anything less than amazing. Just look at these items. Each of them is amazing since they split stuff.

Off-Road Super Racing

Trucks here hit 240mph. Blend that top rate with physics from the other fact and this Steam freebie can ship a truck several 100 feet into the atmosphere. At one stage, I misjudged a turn and delivered a truck hurtling vertically up into the heavens. Outdoor surroundings give lots of room for screwy mayhem, but because there is nothing to ruin, there is also not much to think about. Monster trucks have been created to run things over. Even flying is not any replacement.

Monster Trucks Nitro

Another Trials-like stunt festival. Contrary to the officially accredited Battlegrounds, however, Monster Trucks Nitro up stuff up. There is an whole race mode specializing in putting propane tanks around the monitor. Sounds like a waste of gasoline, until you take into account the explosions. Now that is what we're referring to. Explosions are great.

Hit all those, go ahead, and crush a few things. Buses, logs, automobiles; what will get on your own way. Forget those however. Just roll it over. Get atmosphere, profit nitro, and beat your very best time at a version of fact not like our very own.

<a href="http://www.kizid.com/kd-sports/play-monster-race-3d">Monster Race 3D</a>

Just like Windows 95-era pictures? Short haul distances. Square wheels. Wonky physics. It is plausible Dragon Rush 3D sat boxed at a Software Etc. circa 1995, got dropped, then when retail excavators discovered this missing launch, they flashed it to the internet. That is interesting, but it is no Space Cadet Pinball.

Monster Truck 3D Arena Stunts 

This 1 sort of functions, which is nearly shocking in the realm of Flash monster truck games. It's possible to drive. Do not turn, however, since the hopeless courses will consume your own truck. It is a lot of scattered concrete columns with yellow and black warning tags, a hint simply to shut your browser window. Way out in the space is a rollercoaster-like trail that resembles a Hot Wheels monstrosity constructed from the mind of a six year old, but really getting there appears hopeless. A number of efforts sent the truck into the floor, and coming into this trail? Forget it.
